#Honeypots Phishing Campaign

## Description
This project involves setting up and analyzing honeypots designed to detect and study phishing campaigns. The honeypots simulate vulnerable systems to attract malicious actors, allowing us to collect data on phishing tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The goal is to understand phishing methods, track attacker behavior, and gather intelligence that can be used to strengthen phishing detection and prevention strategies.

## Project Goals
- **Detect Phishing Campaigns:** Use honeypots to attract phishing actors and record their activities.
- **Analyze Attack Patterns:** Study phishing methods to understand how attackers target individuals and organizations.
- **Gather Intelligence:** Collect actionable data that helps enhance phishing defense mechanisms.

## Features
- **Honeypot Setup:** Deploy a variety of honeypots that mimic common targets of phishing attacks.
- **Data Collection:** Capture information on attacker behavior, including IP addresses, payloads, and phishing links.
- **Attack Analysis:** Analyze data from phishing attempts to gain insights into attacker techniques and trends.
