## Installation
Cowrie is a popular SSH and Telnet honeypot that lets you log and interact with unauthorized access attempts. Here's a guide to installing Cowrie on your system:

Prerequisites
System: Cowrie typically runs on Linux (Ubuntu or Debian recommended).

Step-by-Step Installation

1. Update System Packages:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade


2. Install Dependencies:

sudo apt install python3 python3-venv libssl-dev libffi-dev build-essential git


3. Create a New User (Optional but Recommended):

sudo adduser --disabled-password cowrie
sudo su - cowrie


4. Download Cowrie:

git clone https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie.git
cd cowrie


5. Set Up a Virtual Environment:

python3 -m venv cowrie-env
source cowrie-env/bin/activate


6. Install Required Python Packages:

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt


7. Configure Cowrie:

Copy the example configuration:

cp etc/cowrie.cfg.dist etc/cowrie.cfg

Edit etc/cowrie.cfg as needed. For example, to enable SSH, ensure that the SSH section is uncommented and configured.



8. Run Cowrie:

bin/cowrie start

To check logs, use:

tail -f var/log/cowrie/cowrie.log


Cowrie should now be running as a honeypot. You can monitor and analyze logs to see the captured activity.
9. Install Splunk

Download Splunk .deb package and install:

sudo dpkg -i splunk_package_name.deb

Start Splunk:

/opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license

Access via http://localhost:8000.



10. Ingest Cowrie Logs into Splunk

Add data input in Splunk:
Settings > Data Inputs > Files & Directories.

Point to Cowrie's JSON log: /opt/cowrie/var/log/cowrie.json.

Assign sourcetype as json and save.



11. Visualize Data in Splunk

Search in Splunk:

index="cowrie" sourcetype="json"

Create dashboards for SSH attempts, attacker commands.

Now Splunk will analyse logs generated by cowrie`s honeypot activity!
